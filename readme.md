## Dimond price prediction machine learning project
# Diamond Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the price of diamonds using various regression algorithms. The diamond's price is influenced by several characteristics, and this project aims to build predictive models to estimate diamond prices based on these features.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of **10 features**, with **'Price (in US dollars)'** as the dependent variable we aim to predict. The features are as follows:

1. **Carat**: Represents the weight of the diamond in carats. Heavier diamonds tend to be more valuable due to their rarity.
  
2. **Cut**: Indicates the quality of the diamond's cut, which affects its brilliance. The cut quality is categorized as:
   - Fair
   - Good
   - Very Good
   - Premium
   - Ideal
  
3. **Color**: Refers to the color grade of the diamond, ranging from J (worst) to D (best). Colorless diamonds are generally more desirable.

4. **Clarity**: Measures the transparency and presence of inclusions in the diamond. The clarity grading scale is:
   - I1 (worst quality)
   - SI2
   - SI1
   - VS2
   - VS1
   - VVS2
   - VVS1
   - IF (best quality)

5. **Table**: Represents the width of the diamond's top surface as a percentage of its average diameter.

6. **Price (in US dollars)**: This is the target variable representing the price of the diamond in US dollars.

7. **X (Length)**: The length of the diamond in millimeters.

8. **Y (Width)**: The width of the diamond in millimeters.

9. **Z (Depth)**: The depth of the diamond in millimeters.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to predict the price of diamonds using different regression algorithms. By understanding the relationship between the features and the target variable, we can develop models that provide accurate price predictions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and correcting any inconsistencies.
   - Encode categorical variables (like Cut, Color, and Clarity) into numerical values for model compatibility.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analyze the features to determine their importance in predicting the price.
   - Use techniques like correlation matrices and feature importance plots.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Implement various regression algorithms, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regression
     - Random Forest Regression
     - Gradient Boosting Regression
     - Support Vector Regression (SVR)

4. **Model Tuning**:
   - Optimize hyperparameters for selected models to enhance their performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of different models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.
